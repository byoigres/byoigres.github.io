Hello, my name is Sergio, I'm a Software Developer based in Mexico, I consider
myself a self-learner trying new stuff for fun. I've worked on a variety of
projects using different programming languages and platforms.

## My beginning

I started programming professionally using `C#` and `SQL Server` building
Desktop Applications for `Windows` and a couple of websites with `ASP.net`.
Later migrated completely to the world of Web Development with `PHP` where I had
the opportunity to know more about `Javascript`, `CSS`, `Web Frameworks`, `AJAX`
and by the time, popular front-end libraries and CSS Frameworks like `jQuery`,
`Underscore`, and `Bootstrap`.

Learn `PHP` was awesome, it taught me a lot of how the essentials of the Web
works like `HTTP`, server side-routing, cookies and cache, templates rendering,
exception handling, the famous `MVC Pattern`, security with databases,
prepared statements, regular expressions, assets management, a couple of
things about `Web Servers` configuration, and last but not least CLI programming.
Who could know that a programming language with more than 15 years by the time
could teach you all that stuff? That's why every time I use `PHP` I feel a
little nostalgia ‚ù§Ô∏è , and yes, I never used a `PHP` framework (but I did build
a simple one), thanks to that is probably why I learned about all this stuff.

Web Development was easy, then came `node.js` and everything I knew was
ruined üî•...

Well, not really, but many things that I had never thought of appeared out of
nowhere.

## Have you ever heard about `asynchronous programming`?

No? Well, back then neither did I and it did sucks. `node.js` introduced me the
concept of `callback` which _is a function that is passed as an argument to another
function and is expected to be called at a given time_. Easy right? It really was
but after using a bunch of the amazing collection of _async_ functions of node
the code started to look a little messy.

I present to you [**The Callback Hell**](http://callbackhell.com/) üéä, the one
and only concept that makes your code looks with a vertical pyramid and
highlights its excessive use of the `})`.

My choice I love to use Unix based systems like Linux and Mac and of lately Windows with
WSL2.

## How did I get into programming?

## What are my development skills?

These last two years I been working in depth with node.js building backend
services like API's and server-side programs using Express.js and Hapi.js
frameworks
