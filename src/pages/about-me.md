Hello, my name is Sergio, I'm a Software Developer based in Mexico. I consider myself a self-learner, always trying to learn new stuff for fun and understand how the things works.

Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of projects using different programming languages and platforms, from CLI applications running on a Raspberry Pi to building a complete backend architecture to handle web traffic to other services.

I love to use Unix-based systems like Linux and Mac and but lately I been using Windows with [**WSL2**][wsl2] and I think is a really good option.

These last two years I been working in depth with [**node.js**][node] building backend
services like API's and server-side programs using [**Express.js**][express] and [**Hapi.js**][hapi]
frameworks, all this using [**Docker**][docker] for a better development experience.

I call myself a Fullstack Developer but in reallity I like to know and try a little of every field.
