I‚Äôve worked on a variety of\nprojects using different programming languages and platforms.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>For a TLDR; click here</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>My beginning</h2>\n<p>I started programming professionally using <code>C#</code> and <code>SQL Server</code> building\nDesktop Applications for <code>Windows</code>, it wasn‚Äôt the best Apps I had ever build,\nbecause most of the time there was just a window with a progress bar and a\ncentered button with the text <em>Start</em>, that when it was pressed it, it executed\na store procedure that will call another set of store procedures and then\nupdating a <em>control table</em> to handle the progress.</p>\n<p>Pretty straightforward with the <code>C#</code> code but the store procedures were too\ncomplex for me in 2010. Reading millions of rows from one table, filtering data,\napplying data types conversion, creating multiple temporary tables to later use\na big <code>join</code> query, and apply business logic and formulas as a result of monthly\nsales statistics.</p>\n<p>I have to say that SQL Server is really good\nit was mostly SQL code.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 643px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAA7ElEQVQoz52SWwqFMAxEuz53LK5D/FBUFPFLfL8fkSmkhFLvxxUOHZpJ2iaqLMsoSRJK05SgJXmeO7F9EjXPM63rati2zehxHA3DMBikT/qh1Xme9DwP3fetgQbXdVFVVfpGZVlSURT6FdCIcQ77WSsE+cMGry6kzy7IqK7r9OlN01Df93+DOmif8n2fPM+jIAiormv9rK8hfA0JIC+OY1LTNFHbtoR1WRYNTmIN0Gxgx2xthiL74uohzJi0ve/s4b7vOoDhAFsfx0FRFFEYhiS99spaIUH+Ni7kdDlRFpToGyKApwPWfOqvmEu/UqJNgMd6mP8AAAAASUVORK5CYII='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"execute order 66\"\n        title=\"execute order 66\"\n        src=\"/static/fc952ac5a9c8fd601fd851c6336a5057/b5bda/execute-order-66.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/fc952ac5a9c8fd601fd851c6336a5057/8ff5a/execute-order-66.png 240w,\n/static/fc952ac5a9c8fd601fd851c6336a5057/e85cb/execute-order-66.png 480w,\n/static/fc952ac5a9c8fd601fd851c6336a5057/b5bda/execute-order-66.png 643w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>and a couple of websites with <code>ASP.net</code>.\nLater migrated completely to the world of Web Development with <code>PHP</code> where I had\nthe opportunity to know more about <code>Javascript</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>Web Frameworks</code>, <code>AJAX</code>\nand by the time, popular front-end libraries and CSS Frameworks like <code>jQuery</code>,\n<code>Underscore</code>, and <code>Bootstrap</code>.</p>\n<p>Learn <code>PHP</code> was awesome, it taught me a lot of how the essentials of the Web\nworks like <code>HTTP</code>, server side-routing, cookies and cache, templates rendering,\nexception handling, the famous <code>MVC Pattern</code>, SQL Injection,\nprepared statements, regular expressions, assets management, a couple of\nthings about <code>Web Servers</code> configuration, and last but not least CLI\nprogramming. Who could know that a programming language with more than 15 years\nby the time could teach you all that stuff? That‚Äôs why every time I use <code>PHP</code> I\nfeel a little nostalgia ‚ù§Ô∏è , and yes, I never used a <code>PHP</code> framework (but I did\nbuild a simple one), thanks to that is probably why I learned about all this\nstuff.</p>\n<p>Web Development was easy, then came <code>node.js</code> and everything I knew was\nruined üî•‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Well, not really, but many things that I had never thought of appeared out of\nnowhere.</p>\n<h2>Have you ever heard about <code>asynchronous programming</code>?</h2>\n<p>No? Well, back then neither did I and it did sucks. <code>node.js</code> introduced me the\nconcept of <code>callbacks</code> which <em>is a function that is passed as an argument to\nanother function and is expected to be called at a given time</em>. Easy right? It\nreally was but after using a bunch of the amazing collection of <em>async</em>\nfunctions of node the code started to look a little messy.</p>\n<p>I present to you <a href=\"http://callbackhell.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>The Callback Hell</strong></a> üéä, the one and only\nconcept that makes your code looks like a vertical pyramid and highlights its\nexcessive use of the code blocks like this one <code>(err, cb) => { cb(); }</code>. I‚Äôm not\nexagerating, it really looks messy with some files but thankfully for me, one\nday I found what was suppoused to be the <em>Wordpress for node.js</em>,\n<a href=\"https://ghost.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Ghost</strong></a>, some libraries and frameworks started using another\nlibraries with a new concept for me, <em>Promises</em>.</p>\n<h2>I promise you I will not be messy‚Ä¶</h2>\n<p>‚Ä¶And the promise was fulfilled ‚ú®. Learning promises was hard for me, I mean, the concept looks self-explanatory but\nit kinda doesn‚Äôt. Promises helped me avoid the use of <code>(err, cb) => { cb(); }</code> but introduced the\n<code>.then().then().catch().finally()</code> everywhere. When do you have to use <code>catch</code> or <code>finally</code>? That was the question. It\nwas really better than callbacks, but still did feel like something‚Äôs missing. <code>bluebird</code>, <code>q</code>, <code>when</code>.</p>\n<h2>How did I get into programming?</h2>\n<h2>What are my development skills?</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"A little bit about me","date":"2020-09-25T11:13:00.00Z","description":"A brief of my story into tech","path":"/a-little-bit-about-me/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/a-little-bit-about-me/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
